# Deploy Your Project Locally

While running the tests checks for certain values, fields, and functionality, it is still wise to get a visual confirmation that you know and like what you're deploying.

We can give our Django application a test run using the `runserver` command. Since we're in a containerized environment, we will not use the default `127.0.0.1:8000` but instead `0.0.0.0:8000`.

> **ðŸ’» Try It**
> ```python
> cd demo-code
> python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

This ensures that our application is connected to our database as expected and things are looking great.

Since we're using the DB build from our docker compose, we've pre-seeded the database with some data for you.

Our Dev Container has the ports forwarded so that even in a Codespace, you will be able to view your running project.
